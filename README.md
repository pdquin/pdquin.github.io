# WTF

*WTF gathers the scraps of personal thought and comment along the arc of Paul Quin's working life, including how-tos for designers about geeky things, observations on the cultural and community scene, experiments in writing and design and thoughts on the integrity of language. This page is itself an experiment â€“ in this incarnation, an experiment in using the github idiot file as a blog machine.
